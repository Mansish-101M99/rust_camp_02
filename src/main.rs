/* 
Struct :-- Its a compound type which groups together values of different datatypes in a <T> named data structure. It is similar to tuples 
          but each value can be accessed by its name as they are stored with their names.
-> Struct has to be instantiated with data, think of it as template for instances / objects that you create from it. 
> We can use 'mut' with a struct instance to alter the values within the names it stores.

-> Partial Move :- Within the destructuring of a single variable, both by-move and by-reference pattern bindings can be used at the same time. Doing this will result in a partial move of the variable, which means that parts of the variable will be moved while other parts stay. In such a case, the parent variable cannot be used afterwards as a whole, however the parts that are only referenced (and not moved) can still be used.
